# dna-thingy
Ok so when this project is done you will give it some DNA and it gives you transcribed and translated versions and it will be on my website

but I suck at JS so it'll be a while

If there are any inaccuracies (which is probable) please let me know!

## Progress
* Transcribing: Done
* Translation: Done
* User-inputted values: 30%
* GUI: 10%
* Live: Nope
