# dna-thingy
Ok so this project. you will give it some DNA and it gives you transcribed and translated versions and it is on my website

If there are any inaccuracies (which is probable) please let me know!

## Usage
Just put in a DNA sequence and the RNA and amino acids will be outputed!
The RNA can output any length, but for amino acids to work it must be a multiple of three.

## Accessing
Access it at my website, [here](https://gaminglizard9.github.io/dna/dna.html).
